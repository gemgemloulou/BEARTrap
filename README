1. Generate input for simion & geant
   i. isotope file for precursor contains info about charge states, 
      b-nu coefficient, ion cloud size &c
   ii. RIPL file for daughter
   iii. Use BDGen16-06-08
   	./bd [isotope] [daughter] [# decays] [g/n (1/2)] [FWHM ion cloud]
   iv. Generates aux, geant and simion files for processing and knitting. 

2. GEANT
   i. In the Gen2/BDNbuild directory, ./BDN path/to/whatever_geant.txt
   ii. Change the name of the output from GEANT4_output.txt

Gen2/ - added 07x2019
- original BPT simulation

BDGen16-06-08/ - added 07x2019
- Generates simion and geant files from the precursor and daughter input

En/ 
- Current simulation of neuton energies for the NIM
- Initially two neutron energies (0.1, 1 MeV)
- abv = -0.3333, charge state = 2+, FWHM = 2.5mm 
- BDGen made 1,000,001 decays for each.
