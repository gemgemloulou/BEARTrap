1. Generate input for simion & geant
   i. isotope file for precursor contains info about charge states, 
      b-nu coefficient, ion cloud size &c
   ii. RIPL file for daughter
   iii. Use BDGen16-06-08
   	./bd [isotope] [daughter] [# decays] [g/n (1/2)] [FWHM ion cloud]
   iv. Generates aux, geant and simion files for processing and knitting. 

2. GEANT
   i. In the Gen2/BDNbuild directory, ./BDN path/to/whatever_geant.txt
   ii. Change the name of the output from GEANT4_output.txt
   
3. Simion
   i. Load the .iob into simion, and then change the scales and things:
      Scale = 0.5; Xwb+ = -150; Ywb+ = 75; Zwb+ = -75; Xwo+ = Ywo+ = Zwo+ = 0;
      Rotation = +Z-Y+X; Az = -90; El = 0; Rot = 180;
   ii. The Prg file in the drive is for 137I. The differences for the isotopes is the RF things. 
      For 134Sb: RFFreq A = 0.310e6, B = 0.310e6; C = 0.930e6
      rfVolts A = 200, B = 22.2159, C = 17
      Theta A = -4.530, B = 3.141, C = 2.765
   iii. Running: .\simion.exe --nogui --default-num-particles=[number from BDGen] fly 
               --recording-output=C:\Users\b276918\Sim\path\output.dat 
               --particles=C:\path\to\whatever_simion.ion
               --trajectory-quality=3 C:\Users\b276918\Sim\GRAVEYARD\DN_Trap10WC_2013_52pt5mm.iob
               
 4. Knitting

Gen2/ - added 07x2019
- original BPT GEANT4 simulation

BDGen16-06-08/ - added 07x2019
- Generates simion and geant files from the precursor and daughter input

En/ 
- Current simulation of neuton energies for the NIM
- Initially two neutron energies (0.1, 1 MeV)
- abv = -0.3333, charge state = 2+, FWHM = 2.5mm 
- BDGen made 1,000,001 decays for each. 

SimionFiles/
- contains the iob for gen2. You also need a pa# file, but it's large, so it's on the google drive
- contains the prg file for 137I.
